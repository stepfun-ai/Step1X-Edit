## 1. Introduction
we introduce a state-of-the-art image editing model, **Step1X-Edit**, which aims to provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. 
More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain  the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. 
For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing. 
More details please refer to our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17761).


## 2. Model Usage
### 2.1  Requirements

The following table shows the requirements for running Step1X-Edit model (batch size = 1, w/o cfg distillation) to edit images:

|     Model    |     Peak GPU Memory (512 / 786 / 1024)  | 28 steps w flash-attn(512 / 786 / 1024) |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Step1X-Edit   |                42.5GB / 46.5GB / 49.8GB  | 5s / 11s / 22s |
| Step1X-Edit-FP8   |             31GB / 31.5GB / 34GB     | 6.8s / 13.5s / 25s | 
| Step1X-Edit + offload   |       25.9GB / 27.3GB / 29.1GB | 49.6s / 54.1s / 63.2s |
| Step1X-Edit-FP8 + offload   |   18GB / 18GB / 18GB | 35s / 40s / 51s |

* The model is tested on one H800 GPUs.
* We recommend to use GPUs with 80GB of memory for better generation quality and efficiency.


### 2.2 Dependencies and Installation


python >=3.10.0 and install [torch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) >= 2.2 with cuda toolkit and corresponding torchvision. We test our model using torch==2.3.1 and torch==2.5.1 with cuda-12.1.


Install requirements:
  
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install [`flash-attn`](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention), here we provide a script to help find the pre-built wheel suitable for your system. 
    
```bash
python scripts/get_flash_attn.py
```

The script will generate a wheel name like `flash_attn-2.7.2.post1+cu12torch2.5cxx11abiFALSE-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl`, which could be found in [the release page of flash-attn](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases).

Then you can download the corresponding pre-built wheel and install it following the instructions in [`flash-attn`](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention).


### 2.3 Inference Scripts
After downloading the [model weights](https://huggingface.co/stepfun-ai/Step1X-Edit), you can use the following scripts to edit images:

```
bash scripts/run_examples.sh
```
The default script runs the inference code with non-quantified weights. If you want to save the GPU memory usage, you can 1) download the FP8 weights and set the `--quantized` flag in the script, or 2) set the `--offload` flag in the script to offload some modules to CPU.

This default script runs the inference code on example inputs. The results will look like:
<div align="center">
<img width="1080" alt="results" src="assets/results_show.png">
</div>

### 2.4 Gradio Scripts

Change the `model_path` in `gradio_app.py` to the local path of Step1X-Edit. Then run

```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

Then the gradio demo will run on `localhost:32800`.

## 3. Finetuning

### 3.1 Training scripts

The script `./scripts/finetuning.sh` shows how to fine-tune the Step1X-Edit model. With our default strategy, it is possible to fine-tune Step1X-Edit with 1024 resolution on a single 24GB GPU. Our fine-tuning script is adapted from  [kohya-ss/sd-scripts](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts).

```bash
bash ./scripts/finetuning.sh
```

### 3.2 Inference with Lora

Simply add `--lora <path to your lora weights>` when using `inference.py`. For example:

```bash
python inference.py --input_dir ./examples \
    --model_path /data/work_dir/step1x-edit/ \
    --json_path ./examples/prompt_cn.json \
    --output_dir ./output_cn \
    --seed 1234 --size_level 1024 \
    --lora 20250521_001-lora256-alpha128-fix-hand-per-epoch/step1x-edit_test.safetensors
```

To reproduce the cases below, 

```bash 
bash scripts/run_examples_fix_hand.sh
```


### 3.3 Performances

Here is the the GPU memory cost during training with lora rank as 64 and batchsize as 1:

|     Precision of DiT    |     bf16 (512 / 786 / 1024)  | fp8 (512 / 786 / 1024) |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| GPU Memory   |                29.7GB / 31.6GB / 33.8GB  | 19.8GB / 21.3GB / 23.6GB |

Here is an example for our [pretrained Lora weights](https://huggingface.co/stepfun-ai/Step1X-Edit/tree/main/lora), which is designed for fixing corrupted hands of anime characters.

## 4. Benchmark
We release [GEdit-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stepfun-ai/GEdit-Bench) as a new benchmark, grounded in real-world usages is developed to support more authentic and comprehensive evaluation. This benchmark, which is carefully curated to reflect actual user editing needs and a wide range of editing scenarios, enables more authentic and comprehensive evaluations of image editing models.
The evaluation process and related code can be found in [GEdit-Bench/EVAL.md](GEdit-Bench/EVAL.md). Part results of the benchmark are shown below:
